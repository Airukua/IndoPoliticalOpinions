## AN EXPLORATORY FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING AND INTERPRETING PUBLIC OPINION DYNAMICS IN DIGITAL MEDIA

<<<<<<< HEAD
This work presents an exploratory unsupervised framework for identifying thematic fragmentation and sentiment patterns in political discourse from social media comments. The framework integrates text preprocessing, KMeans clustering, LDA topic modeling, and Jaccard distance validation to uncover dominant discussion groups without the need for manual labeling. Through this pipeline, we demonstrate how unsupervised methods can reveal underlying structures in public opinion, including polarization around key political figures.
